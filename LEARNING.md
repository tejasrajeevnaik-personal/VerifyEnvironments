## 📘 Learnings

- 💪 Personal Growth
    - Identifying a genuine project problem — repetitive manual checks that were slow and error-prone
    - Visualizing the end-to-end solution and planning the approach (an exiting idea 💡)
    - Breaking the work into a detailed 3-week timeline with clear goals
    - Researching tricky issues and systematically solving them
    - Continuously improving code structure for better modularity and efficiency
    - Working outside office hours to complete the project faster and setting high expectations for myself
    - Satisfaction of solving a real project pain point and delivering a solid value-add


- 🧠 Technical Growth
    - Gained knowledge across the project tech stack: Python, unittest, pytest, Selenium, PowerShell, Batch scripting,
      paramiko, ssl, ftplib, smtplib, email, Git, and GitHub workflows YAML
    - Improved Selenium skills — identifying reliable locators and using headless browser automation
    - Gained confidence in automating complex login flows: SSO, TOTP/OTP, SFTP (password + SSH key) and FTPS
    - Built solid hands-on experience with secure secret management using temporary session-based environment variables
    - Learned to generate simple yet effective report using JSON output file
    - Gained confidence in designing reusable utilities, method layers, and clean Pytest tests
    - Improved architectural thinking with design patterns such as Factory, Page Object Model (POM), BDD-style
      structuring, and Template Method
    - Gained basic understanding of CI/CD workflows through GitHub Actions
    - Gained hands-on experience with configuring Dependabot, setting up GitHub secret scanning, integrating
      GitGuardian, strengthening security using Bandit (SAST), and applying code-quality practices with flake8
    - ⭐ **Gained confidence in designing and delivering an end-to-end automation system independently**
